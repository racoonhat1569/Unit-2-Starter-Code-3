            <p>Aparthied was a big part of history in South Africa, where the europeans colonized them and made a rule where whites and africans couldnt meet each other or socialize with one another. Both races coudlnt even live in the same block. If both of the races had a child they had to take away the privelge of both parents and put it in the orphanage. This shows that they didnt give them freedom
